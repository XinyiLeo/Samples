/* This file is an explanation for the programming homework of Xinyi Wu (5133709030) */
The program randomly generate 2 numbers that are 4096 bits.
	The output format is like:

	The first number:  
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	
	The second number: 
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	 
	There greatest common factor calculated by Eucilidean algorithm: 
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	
	There greatest common factor calculated by embeded function 
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	

	(And we can see that the two gcds are the same)
