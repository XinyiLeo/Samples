% Eratosthenes found that at the noon of the summer solstice the sun
% radiates directly to a well located in Wenet,Greek. At the same time ,the
%sunlight will casts shadow on a tower located at Alexandria, which is 
%about 5,000 stadia (1 stadia = 157.5 meters)away from Wenet. Then he calculate 
% the angle between the sunlight and the ground made by arctagenting the length
% of the shadow and the height of the tower, which is exactly the central 
% angle(7бу12') corresponding to the distance betwwen Wenet and Alexandria.
% Therefore he can calculate the circumference by the distance and angle.
